# 10 Git Problems

1. Commit is too big
2. Accidental commit to `master`
3. I'm in a detached head state
4. What broke my code?
5. I want to merge two repositories
6. I want to undo a recursive merge (without GitHub)
7. Forget a binary file
8. How do I remove a submodule?
9. I want to undo a rebase
10. How do I force git pull to overwrite local files?

### 1. Commit is too big

How can I commit only part of a file in Git? (Or, revise commits where I committed too much?)

1. Run `. setup.sh`

Look at the files and history that's been created. You'll see that several files and a history have been created. We want to change the history so the commits are more logical.

First, we need to move those changes back into the working directory so we can re-stage and re-commit.

2. `git reset reset-here` to a certain commit, bringing the changes that should be broken up into the working directory.
3. Use `git add -p` to be specific about how commits are formed. You can use `s` to split even further.
4. When you're done with the activity, run `. reset.sh`.

### 2. Accidental Commit to `master`

I committed to master instead of a branch!

This will use `git reset`, so you should first check that:
- The commits in question are _only local_.
- There are no unintended files in your working or staging directory.

#### Getting started
1. Run `. setup.sh`.
  - This sets a local alias, `git lol`. Use `git lol` and `git status` to see the current state of your repository.
2. Use `git reset` back to the last commit that was meant to be on master.
  - Normally, you could use `git reset origin/master`. For today, use the `reset-here` tag: `git reset reset-here`.
  - Use `git lol` and `git status` again.
3. Create a new branch and checkout to it with `git checkout -b experiment`. (Your working and staging area will come with you!)
4. Stage your changes, and make a commit.
  - :tada: Yay, the commit is now where it should be!
5. Once you're finished, run `. reset.sh`.

### 3. I'm in a detached head state

1. Run `. setup.sh`

A detached head state only means that your `HEAD` pointer is currently pointed _not_ to a branch.

2. You can see this by typing `git lol` (an alias was set in the setup script)

To fix this, to get your `HEAD` attached, you need to point to a branch. You can do this by checking out to an existing branch, or creating a new branch where you are.

3. Let's create a new branch where we are with `git checkout -b more-work`

Now, you're no longer in a detached head state. You can continue working normally on your new branch.

4. Reset the activity with `. reset.sh`

### 4. What broke my code?

Something's been broken, but I don't know what commit broke it.

1. `. test.sh`
1. `. setup.sh`
1. `. test.sh` to find something's broken
1. Before you can use bisect, you need to be in the root directory of the repository. `cd ..`
1. `. 04-what-broke-this/test.sh`
1. `git bisect start`
1. `git bisect bad HEAD`
1. `git bisect good before-activity4`
1. `. 04-what-broke-this/test.sh`
1. `git bisect good` or `git bisect good`, depending on the results of the test
1. Continue until it finds the commit
1. `git bisect reset`
1. `. 04-what-broke-this/reset.sh`

### 5. I want to merge two repositories

1. Run the setup script: `. setup.sh`
1. Add the other repository as a second remote: `git remote add other-repo https://github.com/brianamarie/another-repository.git`
1. Before you try to merge, make sure you have all of the remote tracking branches for all remotes: `git fetch --all`
1. Try to merge the two repositories: `git merge other-repo/master` and notice the error message.
1. Since these two repositories have unrelated histories, we need to specify a particular type of merge: `git merge other-repo/master --allow-unrelated-histories`.

In practice, we would probably want to create a new repository to have the combined histories of both of the other repositories. Then, it would be best to archive the singular repositories.

1. You can see the combined history with the log: `git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all`

### 6. I want to undo a recursive merge (without GitHub)

1. Run `script.sh`
2. Look at the log, and take lineage of commits' parents into account: `git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all`
3. Identify which branch is the "parent" branch of the merge. (The branch you were on when you merged is the parent, so we will refer to it as "1".)
4. Identify the merge commit.
5. Revert the merge commit: `git revert -m <parent> <commit>`.
  - ex: `git revert -m 1 cd4370f`

### 7. Forget a binary file

I committed a binary file a long time ago, how to make git forget about a file that was tracked but is now in .gitignore?

???

### 8. How do I remove a submodule?

???
